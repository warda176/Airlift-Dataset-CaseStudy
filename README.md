PROBLEM STATEMEMNT


-- Store Operators at each express warehouse are responsible to pick and pack
orders that land at a particular warehouse. With the current optimizations, a store operator can
process 70 orders in an 8-hour shift. In order to ensure that warehouses have capacities of
store ops matched to the orders for the upcoming week, we need to ensure that we can
estimate the number of orders that we will deliver in the upcoming week.

● Forecast daily orders for the next week (9th November, 2021 - 15th November, 2021)
for both, EW1 and EW2.

● Suggest the number of store operators we should have at each of the aforementioned
Express Warehouses.
